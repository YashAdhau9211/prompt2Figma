Create a modern Spotify-inspired landing page wireframe with a clean, bold, and music-focused design.

Header Section (Top Navigation):

Spotify logo on the left.

Navigation links: 'Premium', 'Support', 'Download'.

Right side: 'Sign Up' and 'Log In' buttons.

Hero Section (Top Banner):

Full-width hero banner placeholder with background image/gradient.

Overlay text: 'Millions of songs. Free on Spotify.'

Primary CTA button: 'Get Spotify Free'.

Secondary CTA button: 'Get Premium'.

Playlist / Content Sections (Scrolling):

Title: 'Recently Played' → horizontal scrollable row of square playlist/album placeholders.

Title: 'Made for You' → personalized playlists row.

Title: 'Trending Now' → horizontal scroll of popular songs/albums.

Title: 'Top Charts' → numbered list style with rectangular album/playlist cards.

Special Highlights Section (Optional):

Banner placeholder for 'Discover Weekly' or 'Release Radar'.

Promotional section for Premium plans with CTA button 'View Plans'.

Footer Section:

Links: 'About', 'Jobs', 'For the Record', 'Privacy Policy', 'Cookies', 'Legal'.

Social media icons: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.

Text placeholder for '© Spotify'.

Style Details:

Minimal wireframe with focus on structure: rectangles for banners, squares for albums/playlists, lines for text.

Vertical scrolling layout with multiple horizontal content rows.

Clear hierarchy: bold hero banner on top, playlist rows below.

Keep layout mobile-responsive, but design for desktop first.

Generate this as a wireframe only (no high-fidelity images or colors, just placeholders for layout and structure).
