## Introduction

The Stateful Iterative Design Engine enables users to make sequential, conversational edits to their UI designs while maintaining context and design history. This feature transforms the current one-shot generation approach into an interactive, iterative workflow where users can refine their designs through natural language commands like "make it sticky", "add a search bar", or "change the color to blue".

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to make sequential edits to my generated design using natural language prompts, so that I can iteratively refine my UI without starting from scratch each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an initial prompt THEN the system SHALL generate a wireframe and store the initial design state with version 1
2. WHEN a user provides a follow-up edit prompt THEN the system SHALL interpret the edit in the context of the current design state
3. WHEN a user makes an edit THEN the system SHALL update the design state and increment the version number
4. WHEN a user requests an edit THEN the system SHALL complete the edit in under 5 seconds
5. IF a user makes 50 sequential edits THEN the system SHALL maintain performance without significant degradation (no more than 20% increase in processing time)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain a versioned history of design changes, so that I can track the evolution of the design and potentially revert to previous versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a design state is created or modified THEN the system SHALL store it as a JSON object in Redis with a unique version identifier
2. WHEN storing design state THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as timestamp, user prompt, and change summary
3. WHEN retrieving design state THEN the system SHALL return the complete design structure in under 200ms
4. WHEN a design reaches 50 versions THEN the system SHALL maintain all version history without data loss
5. IF the Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and inform the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand contextual references in my edit prompts, so that I can use natural language like "make it bigger" or "change the button color" without having to specify exactly which element I'm referring to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user refers to "it" or "the button" THEN the system SHALL identify the most recently created or modified element of that type
2. WHEN a user provides a contextual edit THEN the system SHALL correctly apply 98% of sequential edits without misinterpreting context
3. WHEN an edit prompt is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification rather than making incorrect assumptions
4. WHEN processing contextual edits THEN the system SHALL maintain a context window of the last 10 interactions
5. IF context cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL provide specific options for the user to choose from

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to track user engagement with the iterative design feature, so that I can measure adoption and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts an iterative design session THEN the system SHALL log the session start with user identifier and timestamp
2. WHEN a user makes an edit THEN the system SHALL track the edit type, processing time, and success status
3. WHEN a design session ends THEN the system SHALL calculate and store session metrics including total edits, session duration, and user satisfaction indicators
4. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on average edits per session, most common edit types, and performance trends
5. IF analytics data collection fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without impacting user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the iterative design engine to integrate seamlessly with the existing pipeline, so that users can switch between one-shot generation and iterative editing without friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user generates an initial wireframe THEN the system SHALL automatically create a design session for potential iterative edits
2. WHEN a user switches from iterative mode to code generation THEN the system SHALL use the latest design state as input
3. WHEN integrating with existing endpoints THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with current API contracts
4. WHEN a design session is active THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of the current state and available actions
5. IF a user abandons a session THEN the system SHALL clean up resources after a configurable timeout period
