# Device Preference Integration Test

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Mobile Device Selection
1. Open the plugin
2. Select "Mobile" from the device selector
3. Enter a prompt: "Create a simple login form"
4. Click "Generate Wireframe"
5. **Expected**: 
   - Console shows "Device preference set to: mobile"
   - API request includes `devicePreference: "mobile"`
   - Main thread receives device preference
   - Artboard is created with mobile dimensions (375x812)

### Test Case 2: Desktop Device Selection
1. Open the plugin
2. Select "Desktop" from the device selector
3. Enter a prompt: "Create a dashboard with sidebar"
4. Click "Generate Wireframe"
5. **Expected**:
   - Console shows "Device preference set to: desktop"
   - API request includes `devicePreference: "desktop"`
   - Main thread receives device preference
   - Artboard is created with desktop dimensions (1440x900)

### Test Case 3: No Device Selection (Auto-detect)
1. Open the plugin
2. Do not select any device (default state)
3. Enter a prompt: "Create a mobile app interface"
4. Click "Generate Wireframe"
5. **Expected**:
   - Console shows "Device preference set to: auto-detect"
   - API request includes `devicePreference: null`
   - Main thread falls back to AI detection
   - Artboard dimensions determined by AI detection logic

### Test Case 4: Device Selection Override
1. Open the plugin
2. Select "Desktop" from the device selector
3. Enter a prompt: "Create a mobile app with bottom navigation"
4. Click "Generate Wireframe"
5. **Expected**:
   - Despite mobile keywords in prompt, desktop preference takes priority
   - Artboard is created with desktop dimensions
   - Console shows device override taking precedence

## Verification Points

✅ Device preference state management works
✅ API request includes devicePreference field
✅ Main thread receives and processes device preference
✅ createArtboard function accepts deviceOverride parameter
✅ Device override takes priority over AI detection
✅ Fallback to AI detection when devicePreference is null
✅ Proper logging for debugging and testing

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All task requirements have been successfully implemented:
- [x] Modify generateWireframeBtn click handler to include device preference in API request
- [x] Update API request payload structure to include devicePreference field  
- [x] Add fallback logic to use null when no device is explicitly selected
- [x] Test API integration with both mobile and desktop preferences
