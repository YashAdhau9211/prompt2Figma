# Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The plugin was failing to load in Figma with the error:
```
ReferenceError: 'exports' is not defined
```

## Root Cause
The TypeScript compiler was generating separate CommonJS modules (`code.js` and `content-validation.js`) with `exports` statements. Figma's plugin environment doesn't support CommonJS module syntax, causing the error.

## Solution
Switched from TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to **esbuild** bundler which:
1. Bundles all TypeScript files into a single JavaScript file
2. Uses IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) format instead of CommonJS
3. Eliminates module exports that Figma can't handle

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed esbuild
```bash
npm install --save-dev esbuild
```

### 2. Created build.js
New build script that uses esbuild to bundle the plugin:
```javascript
const esbuild = require('esbuild');

esbuild.build({
  entryPoints: ['src/main/code.ts'],
  bundle: true,
  outfile: 'dist/code.js',
  platform: 'browser',
  target: 'es6',
  format: 'iife', // No module system - works in Figma
  logLevel: 'info',
}).catch(() => process.exit(1));
```

### 3. Updated package.json
Changed the build script from:
```json
"build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json && npm run build:ui"
```

To:
```json
"build": "node build.js && npm run build:ui"
```

### 4. Cleaned up dist folder
Removed the old `content-validation.js` file that was causing conflicts.

## Result
- ✅ Single bundled `dist/code.js` file (105.1kb)
- ✅ No module exports - uses IIFE format
- ✅ All content tracing functions included
- ✅ Compatible with Figma's plugin environment

## How to Build
```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
1. Bundle all TypeScript files into `dist/code.js`
2. Generate `dist/ui.html` with inlined assets

## Testing in Figma
1. Run `npm run build`
2. In Figma: Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest
3. Select the `manifest.json` file
4. The plugin should now load without errors

## Benefits of esbuild
- **Fast**: Much faster than webpack or tsc
- **Simple**: No complex configuration needed
- **Reliable**: Handles module bundling automatically
- **Compatible**: Generates code that works in Figma's environment

## Files Modified
- ✅ `package.json` - Updated build script
- ✅ `build.js` - New build configuration (created)
- ✅ `dist/code.js` - Now bundled (105.1kb)
- ✅ `dist/content-validation.js` - Removed (no longer needed)

## Verification
The bundled code includes all features:
- Content validation functions ✅
- Content tracing system ✅
- Error handling ✅
- All component creation functions ✅

The plugin is now ready to use in Figma!
