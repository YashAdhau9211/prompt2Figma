## Feature Verification

### 1. Content Trace Log with Full Path ✅

**Verified:**
- Path stack correctly tracks component hierarchy
- Full paths are generated (e.g., "Root > ProductCard > ProductName")
- Nested paths work correctly
- Multiple components at same level handled properly

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ should trace content resolution with path
✓ should track nested component paths correctly
✓ should handle multiple components at same level
```

### 2. Summary Report of Content Sources ✅

**Verified:**
- Statistics calculation is accurate
- Component type tracking works
- Source breakdown is correct
- Report generation includes all required information

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ should calculate correct statistics
✓ should track component types
✓ should generate a text report
```

### 3. Console Commands to Export Trace Logs ✅

**Verified:**
- `exportContentTraceJSON()` produces valid JSON
- JSON includes summary and entries
- Export timestamp is included
- All trace data is preserved

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ should export trace as JSON
```

### 4. Visual Indicators in Figma ✅

**Verified:**
- Text nodes are labeled with indicators
- Indicators correctly reflect content source:
  - `✓` for explicit content
  - `⚡` for fallback content
  - `⚠️` for generated content
  - `❌` for errors

**Implementation Location:**
- `src/main/code.ts` - `createText()` function
- Lines where node names are set with indicators

### 5. Trace Control Functions ✅

**Verified:**
- Enable/disable tracing works
- Tracing respects enabled state
- Clear function removes all entries
- State is maintained correctly

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ should enable and disable tracing
✓ should not record when disabled
✓ should clear trace log
```

### 6. Filtering and Querying ✅

**Verified:**
- Filter by explicit content works
- Filter by generated content works
- Filter by content source works
- Get entries for specific component works

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ should filter explicit content entries
✓ should filter generated content entries
✓ should filter by content source
✓ should get entries for specific component
```

### 7. Property Tracking ✅

**Verified:**
- All checked properties are recorded
- Undefined properties are tracked
- Property values are preserved
- Property tracking works for all sources

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ should track all checked properties
✓ should track undefined properties
```

## Integration Verification

### Code Integration Points

**1. content-validation.ts ✅**
- Added `ContentTraceEntry` interface
- Added `ContentTraceLog` class
- Added all tracing functions
- All exports working correctly

**2. code.ts ✅**
- Imports updated with tracing functions
- `createNode()` has enter/exit trace calls
- `createText()` has trace resolution call
- `createButton()` has trace resolution call
- `createInput()` has trace resolution call
- Message handlers added for trace commands
- Visual indicators added to text nodes

### Backward Compatibility ✅

**Verified:**
- All existing tests still pass (331/331)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Tracing is optional and can be disabled
- Performance impact is minimal

## Documentation Verification

### Created Documentation ✅

**1. CONTENT-TRACING-GUIDE.md**
- Comprehensive usage guide
- API reference
- Examples and best practices
- Troubleshooting section

**2. TASK-10-SUMMARY.md**
- Implementation summary
- Feature list
- Technical details
- Test results

**3. test-task-10-verification.md** (this file)
- Verification report
- Test results
- Feature verification

## Requirements Satisfaction

### Task Requirements

✅ **Add a content trace log that shows the full path of content resolution for each component**
- Implemented with `ContentTraceLog` class
- Full path tracking with component hierarchy
- Tested and verified

✅ **Create a summary report of all content sources used in a wireframe**
- Implemented `generateContentTraceReport()`
- Implemented `getContentTraceStats()`
- Statistics include source breakdown and component types
- Tested and verified

✅ **Add console command to export content trace logs**
- Implemented `exportContentTraceJSON()`
