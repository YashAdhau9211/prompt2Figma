# Backend Fix Summary - Text Component Format

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The backend now ensures that **Text components always have their text content in `props.text`** instead of in the `children` array.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AI Model Instructions (`app/tasks/pipeline.py`)
Added explicit rules to the system prompt:
```
TEXT COMPONENT RULES (CRITICAL):
- For Text components (type: 'Text'), text content MUST be in props.text, NOT in children array
- CORRECT: {"type": "Text", "props": {"text": "Hello World"}, "children": []}
- INCORRECT: {"type": "Text", "props": {}, "children": ["Hello World"]}
```

### 2. Automatic Sanitization Function
Created `sanitize_text_components()` that:
- ✅ Detects Text components with strings in children
- ✅ Moves string content to `props.text`
- ✅ Removes primitive values from children arrays
- ✅ Ensures children only contains component objects
- ✅ Works recursively on nested structures

### 3. Validation Function
Created `validate_component_structure()` that:
- ✅ Checks for Text components with strings in children
- ✅ Validates children arrays only contain objects
- ✅ Logs validation issues for debugging
- ✅ Provides detailed error paths

### 4. Integration
- Sanitization runs automatically after JSON generation
- Validation runs after sanitization with logging
- No breaking changes to existing API

## 📊 Test Results

All 7 test cases passed:
- ✅ Text with string in children → Fixed
- ✅ Text with multiple strings → Combined and fixed
- ✅ Text with correct format → Unchanged
- ✅ Nested Text components → All fixed
- ✅ Mixed children (invalid) → Filtered correctly
- ✅ Text without props → Props added
- ✅ Deeply nested structures → All levels fixed

## 📝 Format Examples

### Before (Incorrect)
```json
{
  "type": "Text",
  "props": {"fontSize": "24px"},
  "children": ["MSSU LMS"]  // ❌ Wrong
}
```

### After (Correct)
```json
{
  "type": "Text",
  "props": {
    "fontSize": "24px",
    "text": "MSSU LMS"  // ✅ Correct
  },
  "children": []
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Data Consistency** - All components follow the same structure
2. **Figma Compatibility** - Proper format for Figma operations
3. **Type Safety** - Easier to validate and type-check
4. **Frontend Simplification** - Less sanitization needed on frontend
5. **Debugging** - Clear structure makes issues easier to identify

## 📂 Files Modified

- `app/tasks/pipeline.py` - Main implementation
  - Added `sanitize_text_components()` function
  - Added `validate_component_structure()` function
  - Updated `normalize_children_fields()` to use sanitization
  - Enhanced system prompt with Text component rules
  - Added validation logging

## 📂 Files Created

- `TEXT_COMPONENT_FORMAT.md` - Detailed documentation
- `test_text_component_sanitization.py` - Test suite
- `BACKEND_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
conda activate prompt2figma-env
python test_text_component_sanitization.py
```

Expected output: `✅ All tests passed!`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy** - The fix is ready for deployment
2. **Monitor** - Check logs for validation warnings
3. **Frontend** - Frontend sanitization can now be simplified (optional)
4. **Documentation** - Share `TEXT_COMPONENT_FORMAT.md` with team

## 💡 Notes

- The fix is **backward compatible** - old sessions will be sanitized automatically
- The AI model will now generate correct format from the start
- Sanitization acts as a safety net for edge cases
- Validation provides visibility into any issues

## ✨ Impact

- **Zero breaking changes** - Existing code continues to work
- **Automatic correction** - No manual intervention needed
- **Better data quality** - Consistent structure across all components
- **Improved reliability** - Validation catches issues early
