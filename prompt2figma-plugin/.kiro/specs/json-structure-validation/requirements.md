# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides comprehensive JSON structure validation and automatic repair capabilities for wireframe data structures. The system will detect structural inconsistencies, validate data types, and provide automatic repair mechanisms to ensure JSON data conforms to expected schemas before processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically validate JSON structure integrity, so that I can catch data format issues before they cause rendering failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON structure is received THEN the system SHALL validate that all `children` fields are arrays
2. WHEN a JSON structure is received THEN the system SHALL validate that required fields exist on each node
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with specific node paths
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL log successful validation with structure statistics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic repair of common JSON structure issues, so that minor data inconsistencies don't break the entire rendering process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a `children` field is not an array THEN the system SHALL convert it to an empty array
2. WHEN a `children` field is null or undefined THEN the system SHALL set it to an empty array
3. WHEN a node has invalid structure THEN the system SHALL apply default values for missing required fields
4. WHEN repairs are made THEN the system SHALL log all repair actions with specific details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed validation reporting, so that I can understand exactly what issues were found and how they were resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report of all issues found
2. WHEN repairs are made THEN the system SHALL include repair actions in the validation report
3. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on nodes processed, errors found, and repairs made
4. IF validation fails critically THEN the system SHALL prevent further processing and provide clear error guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable validation rules, so that I can adapt the validation to different JSON schema requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring validation THEN the system SHALL allow specification of required fields per node type
2. WHEN configuring validation THEN the system SHALL allow specification of field type requirements
3. WHEN configuring validation THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling automatic repair features
4. WHEN validation rules change THEN the system SHALL apply new rules to subsequent validations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with the existing content validation system, so that structure validation works seamlessly with content resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON is received THEN structure validation SHALL run before content validation
2. WHEN structure validation fails critically THEN content validation SHALL be skipped
3. WHEN structure repairs are made THEN the repaired JSON SHALL be passed to content validation
4. WHEN both validations complete THEN the system SHALL provide a combined validation report
