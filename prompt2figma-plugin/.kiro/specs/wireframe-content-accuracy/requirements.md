# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The wireframe rendering system is generating incorrect content that doesn't match the JSON structure provided by the backend. When users request a Nykaa homepage wireframe, the system displays random placeholder text like "Smart Reports", "Data Insights", and "Cloud Manager" instead of the actual product names, categories, and content specified in the JSON. This issue undermines the accuracy and usefulness of the wireframe generation feature.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Accurate Content Rendering

**User Story:** As a designer using the wireframe plugin, I want the rendered wireframe to display exactly the content specified in the JSON, so that I can see an accurate representation of my design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend provides a JSON with specific text content (e.g., "Product A", "Makeup", "Nykaa") THEN the wireframe SHALL render exactly that text without substitution
2. WHEN a component has a `text`, `content`, or `title` property in the JSON THEN the system SHALL use that exact value for rendering
3. WHEN the JSON specifies product names, category labels, or brand names THEN those exact strings SHALL appear in the rendered wireframe
4. IF a text component lacks content properties THEN the system MAY generate placeholder text, but SHALL NOT override explicitly provided content

### Requirement 2: Smart Content Generation Control

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the plugin, I want the smart content generation to only activate when content is truly missing, so that it doesn't interfere with user-provided content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component has `props.text`, `props.content`, or `props.title` defined THEN the smart content generation SHALL NOT be triggered
2. WHEN a component's text property equals its component name THEN the system SHALL treat this as missing content and MAY generate smart content
3. WHEN generating smart content THEN the system SHALL log this action for debugging purposes
4. IF smart content generation is triggered THEN it SHALL only apply to components without explicit content properties

### Requirement 3: Content Validation and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer debugging wireframe issues, I want clear logging of content sources, so that I can identify where incorrect content originates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering each text component THEN the system SHALL log whether content is user-provided or generated
2. WHEN the JSON is received from the backend THEN the system SHALL log the complete JSON structure for verification
3. WHEN content substitution occurs THEN the system SHALL log the original value, the substituted value, and the reason for substitution
4. IF content rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating which component and what content was problematic

### Requirement 4: JSON Structure Integrity

**User Story:** As a user generating wireframes, I want the system to preserve the hierarchical structure and relationships defined in my JSON, so that the layout matches my intent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JSON contains nested children arrays THEN the system SHALL render all children in the correct hierarchical order
2. WHEN a component has multiple text properties THEN the system SHALL prioritize them in the order: `text` > `content` > `title`
3. WHEN processing the JSON THEN the system SHALL NOT skip or duplicate components
4. IF a component type is unsupported THEN the system SHALL log a warning but continue processing other components
